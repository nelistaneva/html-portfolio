<h3>25th Hour</h3>
<p> I was very excited for this movie, since in general I really enjoy Eward Norton performances, but it did not live up to my expectations. It had pottential, but just lacked in plotline. I give it 1.5/5 stars.</p>
<h3>Challengers</h3>
<p>4.5/5 stars. I liked this movie a lot, it was beautifully shot, the actors' perfomance was great and the dynamics they explored were interesting. </p>
<h3>Saltburn</h3>
<p> This movie was something I was looking forward to. Good cast, beautiful cinematography and soundtrack ... but it was a little bit disturbing. Went in a very different dircection than what I was expecting. I give it 3.5/5 stars.</p>
